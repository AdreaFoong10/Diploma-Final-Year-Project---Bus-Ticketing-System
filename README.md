## About the Project
CometBus is designed to address common issues faced at physical bus stations, such as long queues, overcrowding, and time-consuming ticket purchases.

With the increasing reliance on internet-based services, users now prefer to book tickets online rather than waiting in line. CometBus allows users to **search, book, and pay for bus tickets online**, offering a faster and more convenient alternative to traditional ticket counters.

The system emphasizes:
- Clear and complete information
- Accurate and transparent pricing
- Simple and user-friendly booking flow
- 24/7 accessibility from any location with an internet connection
